### Overview
SHART stands for Space and High Altitude Recovery and Telemetry (or something, rocket tracker?). We use widely available commercial sensors to estimate the rocket's altitude, velocity, position, trajectory, etc. This information helps us figure out what went wrong when things inevitably do go wrong, gives us an idea of how we are achieving our goals, and helps us recover the rocket after its flight.

At a high level, the system's functionality can be separated into two parts: collection and transmission. SHART reads data from peripheral sensors over SPI or serial interfaces. It then packages the collected data into a packed struct which can be represented as an array of bytes, stores it on an SD card or integrated memory chip, and sends it to the ground station via a radio module. There is other stuff going on, but this is the essence of SHART. The logic is separated across files as follows:

- The `Shart` class (declared in `shart.h`, split across multiple .cpp files) unifies all functionality with a minimal public interface. It includes methods for initializing everything, collecting data, reconnecting lost chips, and transmitting data. It handles data storage and communication with the minimal custom communications library, `comms.h`. The `Shart` class contains persistent data packet structs which are overwritten between collection cycles.
- `shart.cpp` contains implementations for everything in the public interface of the `Shart` class, including top-level functions for the initialization of Shart, collection from all sensors, and transmission. Everything in the other files is private to `Shart`.
- `sensors.cpp` contains the implementations for lower-level sensor-specific methods of the `Shart` class. Most of these methods are specific to a particular sensor, for example, `collectDataADXL375()` and `initBMP388()`. Most of these are simply written according to driver APIs.
- `gps.cpp` contains GNSS-specific functions. At each iteration of the loop, we check if there is new data from the GPS module, if so, we fill a gps packet and set the `gps_ready` flag.
- `export.cpp` contains the implementations for lower-level transmission and storage methods of the `Shart` class. This includes initialization of storage module and radio along with actual storage and transmission logic.

More details can be found in comments throughout the code. To use the library, simply include `shart.h`.

### Debugging
This library relies entirely on macros for debugging. The actual code for the macros is in `debug.h`. To enable and disable debugging settings, either uncomment or comment the respective definitions in the `debug.config` file:

- `DEBUG_MODE_ERROR` prints errors to serial, e.g. initialization or SD write failures.
- `DEBUG_MODE_DATARATE` prints the output data rate in Hz, every 1 second.
- `DEBUG_MODE_STATUS` prints a line to serial whenever the status of a sensor changes.
- `USB_SERIAL_MODE` sends everything over USB serial instead of radio serial.
- `START_ON_POWERUP` allows shart to start running immediately without receiving bytes.

If you add a debugging option, make sure to update the README.

### Data Specifications
For details on the output data format, please refer to the `comms` library, which defines the packet headers, the structs for each packet type, and the checksum logic. These packets are designed to be packable, if possible, and should be easily parsable (e.g., using the `struct` library in Python). Python code to parse from serial or a `.poop` file is in the python folder of Aerobing-Firmware

### Device Drivers
Most of the drivers that Shart depends on are modified versions of code found online. 

- While we restructured the library, most of the underlying logic of the Ublox NEO-7M driver is heavily based on Loginov's code from GitHub.
- The BMP3XX driver is essentially identical to the Adafruit BMP driver. Some changes have been made, including a (useful) chipID() function and a significant optimization; Adafruits's library uses FORCED mode by default, we changed this to NORMAL mode. We now avoid resetting configurations at each data read. The original may have intended to save power, but we found it too be intolerably slow.
- The ICM20948 library is from Zane Lindstrom on GitHub, who seems to have some insider knowledge about Invensense's proprietary firmware (it was the only library that really worked with the DMP). We did not touch the underlying C API, but we made significant improvements to the C++ interface.
- The ADXL375 library is unmodified from Adafruit.
- Note: in the future, we may switch away from the Adafruit libraries
