### Overview
SHART stands for Space and High Altitude Recovery and Telemetry (or something, rocket tracker?). We use widely available commercial sensors to estimate the rocket's altitude, velocity, position, trajectory, etc. This information helps us figure out what went wrong when things inevitably do go wrong, gives us an idea of how we are achieving our goals, and helps us recover the rocket after its flight.

At a high level, the system's functionality can be separated into two parts: collection and transmission. SHART reads data from peripheral sensors over SPI or serial interfaces. It then packages the collected data into a packed struct which can be represented as an array of bytes, stores it on an SD card or integrated memory chip, and sends it to the ground station via a radio module. There is other stuff going on, but this is the essence of SHART. The logic is separated in the code as follows:

- The `Shart` class (declared in `shart.h`, split across multiple .cpp files) unifies all functionality with a minimal public interface. It includes methods for initializing everything, collecting data, reconnecting lost chips, and transmitting data. It handles data storage and communication with the minimal custom communications library, `comms.h`. The `Shart` class contains persistent data packet structs which are overwritten between collection cycles.
- `shart.cpp` contains implementations for everything in the public interface of the `Shart` class, including top-level functions for the initialization of Shart, collection from all sensors, and transmission.
- `sensors.cpp` contains the implementations for lower-level sensor-specific methods of the `Shart` class. Most of these methods are specific to a particular sensor, for example, `collectDataADXL375()` and `initBMP388()`.
- `gps.cpp` contains GNSS-specific implementations.
- `export.cpp` contains the implementations for lower-level transmission and storage methods of the `Shart` class. This includes initialization of storage module and radio along with actual storage and transmission logic.

More details can be found in comments throughout the code. To use the library, simply include `shart.h`.

### Debugging
This library relies entirely on macros for debugging. The actual code for the macros is in `debug.h`. To enable and disable debugging settings, either uncomment or comment the respective definitions in the `debug.config` file:

- `DEBUG_MODE_ERROR` prints errors to USB serial, e.g. initialization or SD write failures.
- `DEBUG_MODE_DATARATE` prints the output data rate in Hz, every 1 second.
- `DEBUG_MODE_STATUS` prints a line to USB serial whenever the status of a sensor changes.
- `DEBUG_MODE_DATA` prints the full data array to the USB serial port (without skipping any frames).

If you add a debugging option, make sure to update the README.

### Data Specifications
For details on the output data format, please refer to the `comms` library, which defines the packet headers, the structs for each packet type, and the checksum logic. These packets are designed to be packable, if possible, and should be easily parsable (e.g., using the `struct` library in Python). Python code to parse from serial should be available somewhere.
